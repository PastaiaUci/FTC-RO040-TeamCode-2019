# FTC-TeamRO040-Robot-Code
## Description
The code for FTC Team RO040 "SnakeTech", Rover Ruckus 2019 contest.<br>
## Skills gained
During the period I worked with Team SnakeTech I gained a lot of skills including experience utilising the Java programming language, experience with image processing and object detection using DogeCV, as well as hardware skills necessary for building a competitive robot.<br>
## Responsabilities
Being team's lead programmer, I was in charge of 5 other students. Working hand in hand with the assembly department of the team we were able to come up with an efficient robot design and code that would allow us to score a maximum number of points.
## The code
The code was written entirely in Java, utilizing FTC's SDK, and can be found [here](https://github.com/TeodorSocea/FTC-TeamRO040-Robot-Code/tree/main/FTC-RoverRuckus2019/TeamCode/src/main/java).
